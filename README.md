# Black Jack CSharp
This is a simple CSharp console game of blackjack, with hit or stick functionality.
Clone:
```
    git clone git@github.com:SamP10/PokemonCardSim.git
```
How to run:
```
    dotnet build && dotnet run
```
Hit or stick and see if you win against the dealer.

## Future investment
This application is just for me Sam Plant to tinker with CSharp, feel free to clone or use the code as open source.
Future improvements could be:
1. Add AI to play as the dealer.
1. Add Ace complexity to be 1 or 11.
1. Improve visualisation by moving this from a console program to a UI.
1. Add tests for each of the classes.
